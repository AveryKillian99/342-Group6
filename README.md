## Description (about 100 words)

> Application for finding, requesting, and providing taxi services in select locations. Customer side would be a customer profile and the ability to request a taxi service from the customers current location to the desired location, selection of preferred/available drivers, ratings and review after service. Provider side would be a taxi profile with details such as rating, availability times/locations, current location and active or inactive jobs. Admin side would be able to delete or modify ratings for both customers and providers, ban or delete or restrict certain accounts as needed, restrict or block users. 
> Possible questions to answer here:  What is the motivation for the app? Providing transportation for users in certain areas as available especially areas where a taxi-like service is not nearly as common. Features for the app would include profiles and rating for both customers and providers, reviews, location tracking ex: closest available driver is x minutes away, Transportation to x location will be m number of minutes. Common profile and review data but using an API that includes real time location and tracking that updates frequently.
